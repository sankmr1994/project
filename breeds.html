<font color="8e7143">About Siberian Husky:</font>
<br/>
<br/>

The Siberian Husky arrived in North America in the fall of 1908 without fanfare. Most other dogs had taken the more conventional route to our shores across the Atlantic Ocean from countries where they had become well established breeds. This unknown breed of Northern dog, however, sneaked through a remote back door to America quietly and unobtrusively at a point where the peninsulas of Asia and America almost meet.

Imported to Nome, Alaska by the Russian fur trader William Goosak, the team of Siberians was to be entered in the 1909 All Alaska Sweepstakes race of 408 miles with its $10,000 first prize. No one was impressed with Goosak's little dogs, weighing only 40 to 52 pounds, much smaller compared to their longer legged, heavier competitors. The people of Nome referred to the imports as "Siberian Rats."

Siberian Huskies have taken top honors in many races in the ensuing years, but their first race run on American soil will always remain, by far, their most important. Goosak persuaded Louis Thurstrop, a Danish sailor, to drive his team. This team, even though the odds were 100 to 1 against it in the betting, made a tremendous showing and nearly won the race, placing third. Rumor ran rampant in Nome that gamblers had paid off the driver before he reached the finish in order to save them from ruin. It was said that had Thurstrop won, it would have broken the Bank of Nome.

On the strength of their showing of speed and, particularly, endurance under the most trying conditions, Fox Maule Ramsay, a young Scotsman then in Nome and a competitor himself in the 1909 race, went to Siberia in the summer of 1909. Travelling up the Anadyr River to the trading settlement of Markovo, Ramsay procured around 60 of the best specimens of the breed he could find. He entered three teams of Siberians in the 1910 All Alaska Sweepstakes race, one for each of his uncles and one he drove himself. The team entered in the name of Col. Charles Ramsay and driven by John "Iron Man" Johnson, a Swedish Finn, came in first with an elapsed time of 74 hours, 14 minutes, 37 seconds, the best ever time for the 408 mile race held annually through 1917. Fox Ramsay came in second. The third Siberian team, entered for Col. Stuart and driven by Charles Johnson, placed 4th. (The 75th anniversary All Alaska Sweepstakes race was held in 1983, following the same trail and rules as the original race. The winner was 5 time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson. His time was over 10 hours slower than Iron Man Johnson's 1910 winning time.)

The Siberians attained enormous popularity as racing dogs and the amusement prior to the 1910 race turned to admiration. Although Ramsay's dogs and their progeny went on to win many races through the years, it was Goosak's team of stoic little aliens who set the stage for the importation of the greatest of northern racing breeds, the Siberian dog, later to be known as the Siberian Husky.

In 1913, Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian explorer who was the first man to reach the South Pole, began planning an expedition to the North Pole for 1914. His friend, Jafet Lindberg, also a Norwegian, and co-owner of the largest mining company in Nome, offered to buy and train the dogs for Amundsen. From all over the Seward Peninsula, the best Siberians were selected and purchased. This group of sled dogs was turned over to Leonhard Seppala, an employee of Lindberg's and a fellow Norwegian, to be trained for the upcoming expedition. In 1914 Amundsen gave up his North Pole trek due to the start of World War I. Seppala, with the encouragement of the Pioneer Mining Company, continued to train the Siberians, entering them in the last four Sweepstakes races, winning the last three - 1915, 1916, and 1917. The United States entry in World War I ended the great race series.</p>

<br/><br/>
Small dog breeds go back centuries and the Pug history is one of the more interesting ones. Although no one knows for sure exactly how old the Pug is, we know that it dates back at least 2,400 years and originated in China. Obviously the dog has changed since then because of different breeding programs throughout the centuries, but there are references to short-nosed dogs that sound like a Pug going back to 400 years Before the Common Era.

It is interesting to note the history of various dog breeds and the Pug is certainly one of the more fascinating ones. You’ll find his history is quiet distinguished and he was quite the favorite of royalty and even some religious orders. And why not? They’re awfully cute!

Pugs Started Out In China From China they spread to the West...

Pugs Are Very Popular in England. These cute little dogs became quite a favorite with the upper class. They do have a regal bearing, don't they? It is no wonder that this adorable little dog enjoys a worldwide popularity. They are cute, playful, lovable and make the most loyal companion you can find. It's not surprising that when you review the list of names that people have come up with for their Pug that is becomes quite an interesting study. Certainly owners choose a name based on the characteristics of their little friend but, quite often, they choose a name after learning a little bit about the history of this popular breed. When you consider that Pug history is linked to royalty, the naming of your dog takes on increasing importance. Obviously, the most important history is your personal one. You will want to keep an accurate record of all medical information as well as any pedigree information your breeder or pet store has given you. You might also want to keep a scrapbook about your dog. Many people do. Pictures can be a part of your own Pug history. It's very nice to take a look at photographs of your dog through the years so make sure to take lots of pictures. They grow up very quickly!</p>

In the U.S., Halloween always falls on October 31st. This super fun holiday is also celebrated in other countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Bosnia, Ireland, Canada and Australia and it's become very popular in Japan.

In America, the tradition of dressing up and asking for candy dates back to 1911 when it was referred to as 'guising'.

It's always fun to celebrate holidays with your Shih Tzu, and this one is especially nice since many dogs enjoy the extra attention that they receive. 

Halloween typically means both costumes and candy; while you'll want to bypass giving candy to your Shih Tzu (aside from a bit of a few safe ones, as discussed ahead), you can definitely include him or her in the costume part!</p>
